# Password Strength Checker

This Password Strength Checker is a tool designed to evaluate the security levels of passwords. It assesses password complexity, length, character diversity, and entropy, and checks against common and dictionary-based attacks. The tool provides feedback on weaknesses and suggests improvements to ensure compliance with best practices and industry standards.

## Features

- **Complexity Check**: Evaluates the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- **Length Check**: Ensures the password meets a minimum length requirement.
- **Common Password Check**: Verifies if the password is among commonly used passwords.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Calculates the entropy of the password to measure its strength.
- **Feedback and Suggestions**: Provides detailed feedback on password weaknesses and suggests improvements.
